### 🎉 HarmonyOS Package Size Optimization in Action: Treasure Tips Hidden in Official Docs!  

Hello, fellow HarmonyOS developers! Today, while exploring the official documentation, I unearthed a treasure trove of practical "package size optimization" cases! These tips can significantly enhance app experience but are rarely discussed. Let me share them with detailed code explanations and hands-on suggestions to help your app slim down instantly～✨  


### 📦 1. SO Library Compression: Immediate Slimming Technique  
**Problem**: SO libraries (especially C++ ones) occupy significant space, and default packaging doesn’t compress them.  
**Optimization**: Enable compression in `module.json5`:  
```json5  
{  
  "module": {  
    // Key config: Enable SO library compression  
    "compressNativeLibs": true,  
    // ...other configurations  
  }  
}
```  
**Effect**: Take `libc++_shared.so` as an example:  
● Original size: 1108KB → Compressed: 386KB (65% space saved!)  
**Use cases**: Apps with native code (e.g., OpenCV, audio/video processing).  


### 🔄 2. HSP Dynamic Shared Packages: Eliminate Duplicate Resources  
**Problem**: When multiple HAP/HSP packages reference the same HAR static package, resources (e.g., images, code) are repackaged repeatedly.  
**Optimization**: Replace HAR with HSP dynamic shared packages for resource reuse:  
```json5  
// Declare shared resources in HSP's module.json5  
{  
  "module": {  
    "type": "shared",  
    "sharedLibrary": true  
  }  
}
```  
**Code comparison**:  
● ❌ HAR static package: HAP1 and HAP2 each include HAR2 code, causing duplication.  
● ✅ HSP dynamic package: All HAPs share one HSP code copy, stored physically once.  
**Effect**: More resources mean greater savings (especially for images and public component libraries).  


### 🧩 3. OHPM Dependency Conflict Resolution: End Duplicate Compilations  
**Problem**: Multiple modules depending on different versions of the same library cause explosive package growth during merging.  
**Optimization 1 (OHPM <1.5.0)**: Force version uniformity in project-level `oh-package.json5`:  
```json5  
{  
  "overrides": {  
    // Force all modules to use version 1.0.0  
    "your_library": "1.0.0"  
  }  
}
```  
**Optimization 2 (OHPM ≥1.5.0)**: Enable automatic conflict resolution (defaults to the highest version):  
```bash  
ohpm install --resolve_conflict  
```  


### ⏳ 4. On-Demand Loading: Let Users Choose What to Install  
**Problem**: Low-frequency features (e.g., "Annual Report," "Advanced Settings") occupy unnecessary initial package space.  
**Optimization**: Split into independent modules for dynamic download at runtime:  
```typescript  
// Use dynamic import for on-demand module loading  
import("com.example.rareFeature").then(module => {  
  module.showFeature();  
});
```  
**Scenarios**:  
● Non-core features (e.g., customer service, mini-games)  
● Region-specific content (e.g., overseas plugins)  


### 🔍 5. Scanning Tools: Pinpoint Optimization Targets  
HarmonyOS provides a package scanning tool for one-click redundancy analysis:  
```bash  
// Scan HAP package via CLI  
hap analyzer --path ./app.hap  
```  
**Report highlights**:  
● Duplicate files: Delete in-package duplicates or use HSP sharing across packages.  
● Large files:  
  ○ Images → Compress with tools (e.g., TinyPNG).  
  ○ SO libraries → Enable the compression option mentioned earlier.  


### 💡 Additional Practical Tips  
1. **Icon optimization**:  
   ○ Replace PNG with SVG (vector graphics are smaller and scale losslessly).  
   ○ Use HarmonyOS built-in icon libraries to reduce embedded resources.  
2. **Resource obfuscation**:  
   ```json5  
   // Enable in build-profile.json5  
   "buildTasks": ["resource_obfuscation"]  
   ```  
3. **Useless code removal**: Enable ProGuard to retain only runtime-used classes.  


### 🌟 Conclusion  
Package size optimization isn’t an "advanced trick"—it’s a key factor for user retention! All methods above are battle-tested by the HarmonyOS official team. Give them a try～
